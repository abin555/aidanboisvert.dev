title: "Spiritual Journey Reflection"

My Spiritual Journey at ACU has been lackluster to say the least. Entering ACU, I was willing and even a bit excited to go to chapel with my friends. Though this had only weakened and lessened over the years. I took the bible classes in the degree plan as required, but I never invested much energy into them. The reason why is unclear to me, but the general gist of it was a lack of interest.
