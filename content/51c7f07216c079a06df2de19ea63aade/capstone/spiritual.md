title: "Spiritual Journey Reflection"
---

My Spiritual Journey at ACU has been lackluster to say the least. Entering ACU, I was willing and even a bit excited to go to chapel with my friends. Though this had only weakened and lessened over the years. I took the bible classes in the degree plan as required, but I never invested much energy into them. The reason why is unclear to me, but the general gist of it was a lack of interest.

The bible courses I took my freshman year were academically interesting. But not particularly spiritually fulfilling. I enjoyed the historical exploratino of the background of the theological teaching, and the origin of certain church behaviors. But it never satisfied my lack of solid faith in God.

My attendance in Chapel was quite exceptional my freshman year, though looking back on it, it was mostly a social excercise. In the following years, the social draw to chapel waned, and it began to feel like a burden. First it waas that the most opportune time to go to the bean was during chapel, then it became a good time to fit work into my busy schedule. And now, it feels like an afterthought, and a busywork burden from an overly bureaucratic and disconnected university administration. It doesn't help that they change the rules, consequences, schedule, and requirements every semester or so.

Looking back on the past few years, I can reasonably say that I didn't go to ACU for the "Christian University" aspect of the college, and that mindset kept me from growing my faith. I do regret my outlook on chapel the past few years, if only for the social outlet, but at this point, what difference would it make? I still feel Christian, and I do make it to Church, and I believe in the teachings of Jesus. But I don't have the solid theological grounding to root my thoughts and beliefs into.
