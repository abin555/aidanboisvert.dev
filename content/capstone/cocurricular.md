## Bike Ride to Pepperdine

At the beginning of my Junior year, several of my friends and I decided to revive an old Gamma Sigma Phi tradition; bicycling to Pepperdine University in Malibu, California. We spent the better part of the year planning this trip out, organizing a charitable venture to support (Greater Than Three), and determining travel logistics. The plan was to spend Spring Break relay biking 24 hours a day, split between two groups, until we reached Malibu. It took several days, but we raised plenty of money for charity, and had a great time.

Reflecting on this time, I can easily say that it is one of my favorite things I have ever done in college.. Between the sheer difficulty, and hanging out with my friends, it was a genuinely great time. Its very rare today that you slowly travel across the United States, allowing for the contemplation and appreciation of the beauty and environment around you. Especially since I was generally on the night shift, which was an even more unique perspective on the western United States.

## Gamma Sigma Phi

I joined Gamma Sigma Phi in the spring of my Freshman year. It is a social club that is semi-relevant on ACU's campus. Over the past few years, I had several very positive experiences. I helped build the sing song set in my Freshman, Sophomore, and Junior years, and let the efforts to construct the homecoming float as an officer in my Junior year (photo above).

Nowadays, I am a lot less involved in GSP than I used to be. However, it is still one of the most meaningful parts of my experience of ACU. I'm sure that if I had to choose again, I'd still choose to join GSP. Between all the people I've met, memories I've made, and opportunities I've had, its absolutely been worth it to me.
