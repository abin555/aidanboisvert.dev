## SIGCHI 2025 - Yokohama, Japan

Over the course of my Junior year, I worked with the Special Interest Group on Computer Human Interaction at ACU, an HCI research group on campus. The project was to investigate the performance of different keyboard designs with eyetracking as the input. My main contribution was in the development of "glue" interfaces that pull the Tobii eyetracking hardware data into the Unity engine, and some data analysis. Our paper was accepted to the conference in Yokohama, Japan, and we were able to go on a trip to present it.

This is one of my favorite memories of my time at ACU. Being able to go to Japan, as part of a university trip, and attend an actual professional conference was a truely remarkable opportunity. Being able to sightsee, explore, and learn about the culture around us in our spare time made it all the more valuable.

## Presenting @ EPICS Collaboration Meeting - Oak Ridge National Labs

In the Fall of my Junior year, I went to go present my work on the EPICS control system for the NEXT lab at the EPICS collaboration meeting. The conference was at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Lab, Tennessee. One of the most unique opportunities I've had in my life.

This is the time where I've had the most intense sense of imposter syndrome, so badly that I have a pang of it every time I think about my time there. It's not like I didn't fit in, I just felt so out of my depth and maybe a bit embarrassed to have gone infront of so many capable and professional people to present my work. I can't help but hope that they liked the presentation I gave and the work I did.
